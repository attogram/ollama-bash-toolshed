>>> what version of ollama am I running?

ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­ Okay, the user is asking about their Ollama version. Let me check the tools available. There's a function called ollamaManager that can get the version. The parameters require an action enum with options like models_list, model_info, or ollama_version. Since the user wants their current version, the action should be 'ollama_version'. The model parameter is optional here, so I don't need it. Just call the function with action set to ollama_version. No need to mention other functions since the user's query is specifically about their version. ðŸ’­ðŸ¤”

[TOOL] ollamaManager {
  "action": "ollama_version"
}

ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­ Okay, the user is asking about their current Ollama version. I need to check if there's a function available for that. Looking at the tools provided, there's the ollamaManager function which can retrieve the version. The parameters require an action enum with 'ollama_version'. So I should call that function with the action set to 'ollama_version'. No other parameters are needed since the user didn't specify a model. Just make sure to format the tool call correctly in JSON within the XML tags. ðŸ’­ðŸ¤”

The current version of Ollama is 0.9.2.
